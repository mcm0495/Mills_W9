              <h3>Who is Russ</h3>
              <p>Russ was born on September 26, 1992 in Secaucus, New Jersey. He is of Sicilian descent. He has also lived in North Carolina and Kentucky, due to his father having to constantly relocate due to his career, before his family found a permanent home in Georgia. He started writing raps in his notebook at seven years old and started making beats when he was 14.He recorded his first song at 18 years old.
              <h3>Concert Review</h3>
              <p> The feeling of insanity present in that room when "what they want" came on and Russ stepped out was like fire. The whole entire concert was dope, exceeding the expectations especially with the singing. He really moved the crowd, and like he fed off of the energy almost. The lyrical display was intense and smooth, and of course song choice and placement is important and he nailed that too. A couple of things that could have been better, well he could have come out sooner and stayed longer, but I do not hold that against artists because that is not usually in their control. Definately going to see Russ again when I get a chance. -Robert Smith</p>
